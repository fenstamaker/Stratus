Stratus
=======

Prototype content editor using ReactJS

Philosophy
-------

Stratus is a content editor that eschews the popular monolithic structure of content for a new, innovative pattern of 
small composable components. 

Install
-------

You'll need Node.js and NPM installed to build Stratus.

To Install (assuming a fresh download):

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt init`
3. `grunt build`

Afterwards, just run `grunt build` to build any changes.
