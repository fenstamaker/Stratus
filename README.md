Stratus
=======

Prototype content editor using ReactJS

Philosophy
-------

Stratus is a content editor that eschews the popular monolithic
structure of content for a new, innovative pattern of small composable componens.

Install
-------

You'll need Leiningen and JDK 1.7 installed to build Stratus.

To Install (assuming a fresh download):

1. `lein deps`
2. `lein build`

Afterwards, just run `lein build` to build any changes. Run `lein
watch` to have it auto build when it detects any changes. Run `lein
build prod` to build to create production files.
